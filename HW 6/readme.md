Exercise 1. Write a CUDA program that includes a host function to compute the number of even values in a given NxN matrix, N being 8. 
Test your program on aries.ecs.fullerton.edu using the nvcc compiler to make sure it runs.

Exercise 2. Write a CUDA program that includes a host function to compute the square of a given NxN matrix, N being 8. For example, if the matrix given is A with 8x8 elements, the host function will compute the matrix AxA.

**Exercise 1**:
Compile with: nvcc matrix.cu
Execute: ./a.out

**Exercise 2**:
Compile with: nvcc matrix1.cu
Execute: ./a.out
